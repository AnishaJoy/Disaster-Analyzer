# Disaster Advisor – Streamlit App

A Streamlit-based disaster-risk assessment tool that analyzes a location and reports heuristic risk levels for:

- Earthquakes  
- Floods  
- Wildfires  
- Hurricanes / strong winds  
- Snowfall risk  
- Tsunami likelihood  
- Nearby hospitals & shelters  
- Auto-generated action plan 

The app combines live data from:
- **Open-Meteo** (weather & forecast)
- **USGS Earthquake API**
- **OpenStreetMap Overpass API**

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ Live Hazard Detection  
For any location (city name or coordinates), the app gathers:
- Recent earthquakes (mapped with Folium)
- Weather & wind conditions
- Flood risk (via rainfall forecast + historical rainfall)
- Snowfall prediction
- Wildfire risk (temp + precipitation + wind)
- Hurricane wind forecasts

### ✔ Nearby Resources  
Uses Overpass API to find:
- Hospitals / clinics  
- Schools & colleges as proxy shelters  

### ✔ Interactive Visuals  
- Folium maps displayed inside Streamlit  
- Dynamic tables, badges, and multi-tab interface  

### ✔ Optional AI Summary  
If you add a **GEMINI_API_KEY**, the app generates a concise emergency action summary using Google’s Gemini.
